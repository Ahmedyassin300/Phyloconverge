# PhyloConverge

PhyloConverge is a Python package designed to calculate the percentage of convergence between different species at the genetic level, identify possible common ancestors, and draw a phylogenetic tree to illustrate the convergence.

## Features

- Read genetic sequences from a FASTA file.
- Align sequences using ClustalW.
- Calculate genetic convergence between species.
- Construct a phylogenetic tree.
- Visualize the phylogenetic tree using Matplotlib.

## Installation

You can install PhyloConverge using pip:

```sh
pip install phylo_converge
